Today I found myself sitting in college, wondering how well one of my favourite PC games, WarThunder, would play on Linux under Wine.

As the Google page results for "WarThunder linux" loaded, imagine my delight on seeing [this news post](http://warthunder.com/en/news/2608-war-thunder-is-now-available-on-linux-en) from a few days ago, declaring that WarThunder now has a native Linux client!

It currently only supports x64 Linux distros, and has yet to be released on Steam for Linux, but it's a step in the right direction. Having used Linux for more than half a decade, I'm delighted to see the tides slowly turning as more and more of my favourite PC games are released on Linux.

Today is a good day.
