Many years ago, I [read about](http://kmandla.wordpress.com/2010/12/28/jn-a-journal-notebook-tool/) a very simple command line diary tool called JN. Just the other day, I was looking for a similar program, thought of that post, and went back to eagerly grab a copy.

Sadly, the tarball which the post linked to was no longer available (due to the death of omploadr.org).

Therefore, I decided to quickly write my own version of JN. Over the course of about an hour, I put together a few lines of Bash which replicated the abilities of the JN I remembered.

Naturally, I pushed it to [a Github repo](https://github.com/evidex/jn) to share it with the world.
